Changes may be made on occasion without notice, so please take time to review these policies before attending. Violations will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and CFT reserves the right to remove you from the event without refund.</p><h2 id="respect-the-law">Respect The Law</h2><p>You are expected to comply with all federal, state, and local laws. Be aware that various law enforcement agencies regularly patrol our campsite and the surrounding areas, and may be present on-site at any time. Additionally, please follow any instructions given by CFT staff—they have only your best interests at heart!</p><h2 id="respect-the-site">Respect The Site</h2><p>Our event takes place in the Deschutes National Forest, and we must appreciate the privilege of using this beautiful land by aiming to leave it better than we found it. This means you must always clean up after yourself, patrol your own campsite as well as common areas for litter, and dispose of trash in the proper receptacles. We strongly encourage recycling what you can to minimize our overall impact on the land.</p><p>Site Rules, as established and enforced by the Forest Service:</p><ul><li>No open fires outside of fire rings. Fireworks, fire toys, candles, tiki torches, etc. are prohibited.</li><li>Keep structures and vehicles at least 10 feet away from active fire rings.</li><li>Never leave fires unattended, extinguish them “dead out” before leaving or going to sleep.</li><li>Avoid touching, harassing, or otherwise inconveniencing local wildlife.</li><li>No use of soap or shampoo unless it is biodegradable; no soap of any kind in the creek.</li><li>Silly string, glitter, confetti, water balloons, etc. are prohibited due to the difficulty of cleanup.</li><li>Firearms are prohibited.</li><li>Generator users must have an ABC-type fire extinguisher and never run generators unattended.</li><li>Never discard burning material or cigarette butts on the ground, only in fire rings or butt cans.</li></ul><h2 id="respect-each-other">Respect Each Other</h2><p>CFT is dedicated to providing a safe experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, ethnicity, ability, religion, national origin, socioeconomic background, or any other aspect of one’s identity.</p><p>We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: demeaning statements, verbal threats, intimidating behavior, unwanted physical contact, or any other form of unwelcome attention.</p><h3 id="conduct">Conduct</h3><p>Keep public conduct to a “PG-13” rating. If at any time you need assistance resolving a conflict with another attendee, please contact a member of staff for help.</p><h3 id="sound">Sound</h3><p>The site is divided into three camps by noise level:</p><ul><li>Blue Camp (Quiet): No unnecessary noise from 10PM-8AM.</li><li>Green Camp (Quiet, next to Loud): No speakers, instruments, or raised voices from 10PM-8AM.</li><li>Red Camp (Loud): Speakers and instruments must be completely inaudible from Blue Camp after 10PM, and limited to a personal radius from 2AM-8AM.</li></ul><p>Sound systems larger than a personal speaker or jambox are prohibited outside of Red Camp, and must be set up to direct sound away from Blue/Green Camp. Instruments and sound systems must be kept to levels that do not interfere with others’ ability to listen to their own music or converse in normal speaking voices.</p><h2 id="attendance">Attendance</h2><p>There is no on-site registration, and unregistered visitors are not permitted on-site without written permission from the event chair. Per our registration policy, you must show valid photo ID at check-in verifying your age (18+) and identity as a registered attendee.</p><p>Please wear your badge whenever possible so that people can identify you. Wear your wristband at all times, until the event is over. If you see anyone on the site without an event wristband, or if your wristband becomes over-tightened, get help from a member of staff immediately.</p><h2 id="gifts-sales--donations">Gifts, Sales &amp; Donations</h2><p>CFT promotes a “gift” culture, encouraging gifts to be given freely between attendees. Sales of goods or services on-site by attendees is not permitted. However, you may deliver pre-ordered goods to a fellow attendee so long as money was exchanged off-site before the event. You may also accept strictly voluntary donations at your happenings, to help cover the cost of supplies or to raise funds for a bona-fide charity.</p><h2 id="alcohol">Alcohol</h2><p>Open containers of alcohol must be confined to “indoor” spaces (i.e. tents). Attendees sharing alcohol must verify that the recipient is at least 21 years of age. Consumption of alcohol by those under 21 is prohibited.</p><h2 id="pets">Pets</h2><p>Dogs must be pre-registered via the online registration system before registration closes. If you show up with an unregistered pet, you will be denied entry to the event. We may also eject you and your dog from the event if your dog exhibits aggressive behavior or harasses others. (Depending on the circumstances, we might allow you to return after boarding your dog elsewhere.) You must remain in direct control of your dog at all times, and keep them on a fixed-length leash except when entering or exiting the water. You must clean up after your dog. Crating dogs is permitted only while you or the dog’s registered secondary handler remains in the immediate vicinity. Leaving dogs alone for any reason, for any length of time, is strictly forbidden.</p><h2 id="photography--recording">Photography &amp; Recording</h2><p>CFT is a private event, a place where we can be ourselves out of the public eye. It is not open to members of the media or non-participating observers. Photography or recording of video or audio for the purpose of circulation, publication, or sale is expressly forbidden.</p><p>You must not record or photograph anyone who indicates that they do not want to be recorded. You also agree that you will never upload or share any media recorded at CFT without the explicit, informed consent of everyone whose face or voice is identifiable. (You must let people know what you’re going to share that includes them, where and how you’re going to share it, and you must not do so until after you have their permission.)</p><h2 id="vehicles">Vehicles</h2><p>Box trucks, moving vans, and vehicles over 28’ in length are prohibited. You may park next to your campsite to load or unload, but unless you have obtained permission to camp in your vehicle, you must move it to the parking lot after setup. Vehicle in/out is permitted, but the parking tag issued at check-in must be displayed at all times when on-site.</p><h2 id="personal-responsibility">Personal Responsibility</h2><p>Attendees are responsible for others that make use of their property and/or structures. Additionally, attendees are responsible for the security of their vehicles and property. We expect attendees to exercise common sense, e.g. storing valuables in a secure fashion.</p><p>Please direct any Lost and Found inquiries during the event to Public Safety. (After the event is over, post about Lost and Found items on our Forum.)</p></div></div></div><script src="/assets/main-36c004497095275f2293753165dc1ca3.js"></script></body></html>
